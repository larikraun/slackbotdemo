# SlackBot Demo

### This is the source code from my Building SlackBots From Scratch session at the ForLoopWomen 2.0 (23rd of September, 2017)

The idea we worked with was to query the database for upcoming forloopwomen events.

To run the project:

 * Clone the project
 * Install composer for the project
 * Create a bot user on slack and copy the API TOKEN that was given
 * Create a database ```slackbotdemo``` and import the slackbotdemo.sql file included in the project
