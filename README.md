# SlackBot Demo

### This is the source code from my Building SlackBots From Scratch session at the ForLoopWomen 2.0 (23rd of September, 2017)

To run the project:

 * Clone the project
 * Install composer for the project
 * Create a bot user on slack and copy the API TOKEN that was given
 * Create a database ```slackbotdemo``` and import the slackbotdemo.sql file included in the project

#### The project was built on [Sagebind's slack-client](https://github.com/sagebind/slack-client)
